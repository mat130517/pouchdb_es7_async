# pouchdb_es7_async

>Most importantly, async functions make APIs like PouchDB's a lot easier to work with.
So hopefully this will lead to fewer user errors and confusion, as well as more elegant and readable code.*

>And who knows, maybe folks will finally abandon LocalStorage, and opt for a more modern client-side database.*
